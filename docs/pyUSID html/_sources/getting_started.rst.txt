Guide for python novices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For the python novices by a python novice - **Nick Mostovych, Brown University**

#. Learn about the `philosophy, purpose, etc. of pyUSID <./about.html>`_.
#. Get an idea of the different resources available by reading the `getting started <./getting_started.html>`_ section
#. Watch the video on `installing Anaconda <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJC6ldI3hWk>`_ from the `Tutorials on Basics <./external_guides.html>`_ page
#. Follow instructions on the `installation <./install.html>`_ page to install Anaconda.
#. Watch the `video tutorial <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW29067qVWk>`_ from the ``Jupyter Notebooks`` section in `the Tutorials on Basics <./external_guides.html>`_ page
#. Read the whole `Tutorial on Basics page <./external_guides.html>`_. Do NOT proceed unless you are familiar with basic python programming and usage.
#. Read `the document on the USID model and h5USID <./data_format.html>`_. This is very important and highlights the advantages of using USID. New users should not jump to the examples until they have a good understanding of the data format.
#. Depending on your needs, go through the `recommended sequence of tutorials and examples <./auto_examples/index.html>`_

Tips and pitfalls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For the python novices by a python novice - **Nick Mostovych, Brown University**

* Documentation and examples on this website are for the latest version of pyUSID. If something does not work as shown on this website,
  chances are that you may be using an older version of pyUSID. Follow the instructions to `update pyUSID to the latest version <./install.html#updating-pyUSID>`_
* pyUSID has excellent documentation (+ examples too) for all functions. If you are ever confused with the usage of a
  function or class and you can get help in numerous ways:

  * If you are using jupyter notebooks, just hit the ``Shift+Tab`` keys after typing the name of your function.
    See `this quick video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgqMK1SG7XI>`_ for a demo.
    E.g. - type ``px.USIDataset(``. Hit ``Shift+Tab`` twice or four times. You should be able to see the documentation for the
    class / function to learn how to supply inputs / extract outputs
  * Use the search function and reference the source code in the `API section <./api.html>`_ for detailed comments.
    Most detailed questions are answered there.
* Use the `USIDataset <./auto_examples/cookbooks/plot_usi_dataset.html>`_ everywhere possible to simplify your tasks.
* Many functions in pyUSID have a ``verbose`` keyword argument that can be set to ``True`` to get detailed print logs of intermediate steps in the function.
  This is **very** handy for debugging code
