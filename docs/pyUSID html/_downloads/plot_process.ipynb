        "**In this example, we will learn how to write a simple yet formal pyUSID class for processing data.**\n\nIntroduction\n------------\nMost of code written for scientific research is in the form of single-use / one-off scripts due to a few common\nreasons:\n\n* the author feels that it is the fastest mode to accomplishing a research task\n* the author feels that they are unlikely to perform the same operation again\n* the author does not anticipate the possibility that others may need to run their code\n\nHowever, more often than not, nearly all researchers have found that one or more of these assumptions fail and a lot\nof time is spent on fixing bugs and generalizing / formalizing code such that it can be shared or reused. Moreover, we\nlive in an era of open science where the scientific community and an ever-increasing number of scientific journals\nare moving towards a paradigm where the data and code need to be made available with journal papers. Therefore, in the\ninterest of saving time, energy, and reputation (you do not want to show ugly code / data. Instead you want to be the\nparagon of clean intelligible data and code), it makes a lot more sense to formalize (parts of) one's data analysis\ncode.\n\nFor many researchers, formalizing data processing or analysis may seem like a daunting task due to the complexity of\nand the number of sub-operations that need to performed. ``pyUSID.Process`` greatly simplifies the process of\nformalizing code by lifting or reducing the burden of implementing important, yet tedious tasks and considerations\nsuch as:\n\n* **memory management** - reading chunks of datasets that can be processed with the available memory, something very\n  crucial for very large datasets that cannot entirely fit into the computer's memory\n* **considerate CPU usage for parallel computing** - using all but one or two CPU cores for the (parallel) computation\n  , which allows the user to continue using the computer for other activities such as reading mail, etc.\n* **pausing and resuming computation** - interrupting and resuming the computation at a more convenient time,\n  something that is especially valuable for lengthy computations.\n* **avoiding repeated computation and returning existing results** - pyUSID.Process will return existing results\n  computed using the exact same parameters instead of re-computing and storing duplicate copies of the same results.\n* **testing before computation** - checking the processing / analysis on a single unit (typically a single pixel) of\n  data before the entire data is processed. This is particularly useful for lengthy computations.\n\nUsing ``pyUSID.Process``, the user only needs to address the following basic operations:\n\n1. Reading data from file\n2. Computation on a single unit of data\n3. Writing results to disk\n\n\nComponents of pyUSID.Process\n-----------------------------------\nThe most important functions in the Process class are:\n\n* ``__init__()`` - instantiates a 'Process' object of this class after validating the inputs.\n* ``_create_results_datasets()`` - creates the HDF5 datasets and Group(s) to store the results.\n* ``_map_function()`` - the operation that will per be performed on each element in the dataset.\n* ``test()`` - This simple function lets the user test the ``map_function`` on a unit of data (a single pixel\n  typically) to see if it returns the desired results. It saves a lot of computational time by allowing the user to\n  spot-check results before computing on the entire dataset\n* ``_read_data_chunk()`` - reads the input data from one or more datasets.\n* ``_write_results_chunk()`` - writes the computed results back to the file\n* ``_unit_computation()`` - Defines how to process a chunk (multiple units) of data. This allows room for\n  pre-processing of input data and post-processing of results if necessary. If neither are required, this function\n  essentially applies the parallel computation on ``_map_function()``.\n* ``compute()`` - this does the bulk of the work of (iteratively) reading a chunk of data >> processing in parallel\n  via ``_unit_computation()`` >> calling ``write_results_chunk()`` to write data. Most sub-classes, including the one\n  below, do not need to extend / modify this function.\n\nRecommended pre-requisite reading\n---------------------------------\n* `Universal Spectroscopic and Imaging Data (USID) model </../../data_format.html>`_\n* `Crash course on HDF5 and h5py <./plot_h5py.html>`_\n* Utilities for `reading <./plot_hdf_utils_read.html>`_ and `writing <./plot_hdf_utils_write.html>`_\n  h5USID files using pyUSID\n* Crash course on `parallel processing <./plot_parallel_compute.html>`_\n\nExample problem\n---------------\nFor this example, we will be working with a Band Excitation Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (BE-PFM) imaging dataset\nacquired from advanced atomic force microscopes. In this dataset, a spectra was collected for each position in a two\ndimensional grid of spatial locations. Thus, this is a three dimensional dataset that has been flattened to a two\ndimensional matrix in accordance with the USID model.\n\nThis example is based on the parallel computing primer where we searched for the peak of each spectra in a dataset.\nWhile that example focused on comparing serial and parallel computing, we will focus on demonstrating the simplicity\nwith which such a data analysis algorithm can be formalized.\n\nThis example is a simplification of the pycroscopy.analysis.BESHOFitter class in our sister project - Pycroscopy.\n\nImport necessary packages\n-------------------------\n\n"

        "The goal is to **find the amplitude at the peak in each spectra**. Clearly, the operation of finding the peak in one\nspectra is independent of the same operation on another spectra. Thus, we could divide the dataset in to N parts and\nuse N CPU cores to compute the results much faster than it would take a single core to compute the results. Such\nproblems are ideally suited for making use of all the advanced functionalities in the Process class.\n\nDefining the class\n===================\nIn order to solve our problem, we would need to implement a ``sub-class`` of pyUSID.Process or in other words -\n**extend pyUSID.Process**. As mentioned above, the pyUSID.Process class already generalizes several important\ncomponents of data processing. We only need to extend this class by implementing the science-specific functionality.\nThe rest of the capabilities will be **inherited** from pyUSID.Process.\n\nLets think about what operations need be performed for each of the core Process functions listed above.\n\nmap_function()\n--------------\nThe most important component in our new Process class is the unit computation that needs to be performed on each\nspectra. ``map_function()`` needs to take as input a single spectra and return the amplitude at the peak (a single\nvalue). The ``compute()`` and ``unit_computation()`` will handle the parallelization.\n\nThe scipy package has a very handy function called *find_peaks_cwt()* that facilitates the search for one or more\npeaks in a spectrum. We will be using a simplified function called *find_all_peaks()*.\nThe exact methodology for finding the peaks is not of interest for this\nparticular example. However, this function finds the index of 0 or more peaks in the spectra. We only expect\none peak at the center of the spectra. Therefore, we can use the ``find_all_peaks()`` function to find the peaks and\naddress those situations when too few or too many (> 1) peaks are found in a single spectra. Finally, we need to use\nthe index of the peak to find the amplitude from the spectra.\n\ntest()\n------\nA useful test function should be able to find the peak amplitude for any single spectra in the dataset. So, given the\nindex of a pixel (provided by the user), we should perform two operations:\n\n* read the spectra corresponding to that index from the HDF5 dataset\n* apply the ``map_function()`` to this spectra and return the result.\n\nThe goal here is to load the smallest necessary portion of data from the HDF5 dataset to memory and test it against\nthe ``map_function()``\n\ncreate_results_datasets()\n-------------------------\nEvery Process involves a few tasks for this function:\n\n* the creation of a HDF5 group to hold the datasets containing the results - pyUSID.hdf_utils has a handy function\n  that takes care of this.\n* storing any relevant metadata regarding this processing as attributes of the HDF5 group for provenance, traceability\n  , and reproducibility.\n\n    * ``last_pixel`` is a reserved attribute that serves as a flag indicating the last pixel that was successfully\n      processed and written to the results dataset. This attribute is key for resuming partial computations.\n* the creation of HDF5 dataset(s) to hold the results. ``map_function()`` takes a spectra (1D array) and returns the\n  amplitude (a single value). Thus the input dataset (position, spectra) will be reduced to (position, 1). So, we only\n  need to create a single empty dataset to hold the results.\n\nWe just need to ensure that we have a reference to the results dataset so that we can populate it with the results.\n\nwrite_results_chunk()\n---------------------\nThe result of ``compute()`` will be a list of amplitude values. All we need to do is:\n\n* write the results into the HDF5 dataset\n* Set the ``last_pixel`` attribute to the value of the ``end_pos`` internal variable to indicate that pixels upto\n  ``end_pos`` were successfully processed. Should the computation be interrupted after this point, we could resume\n  from ``end_pos`` instead of starting from ``0`` again.\n* update the ``start_pos`` internal variable to guide compute() to process the next batch of positions / pixels\n\n"

        "Flow of functions\n==================\n\nBy default, very few functions (``test()``, ``compute()``) are exposed to users. This means that one of these\nfunctions calls a chain of the other functions in the class.\n\ninit()\n-------\nInstantiating the class via something like: ``fitter = PeakFinder(h5_main)`` happens in two parts:\n\n1. First the subclass (``PeakFinder``) calls the initialization function in ``Process`` to let it run some checks:\n\n  * Check if the provided ``h5_main`` is indeed a ``Main`` dataset\n  * call ``set_memory_and_cores()`` to figure out how many pixels can be read into memory at any given time\n  * Initialize some basic variables\n\n2. Next, the subclass continues any further validation / checks / initialization - this was not implemented for\n   ``PeakFinder`` but here are some things that can be done:\n\n   * Find HDF5 groups which either have partial or fully computed results already for the same parameters by calling\n     ``check_for_duplicates()``\n\ntest()\n-----------\nThis function only calls the ``map_function()`` by definition\n\ncompute()\n----------\nHere is how compute() works:\n\n* Check if you can return existing results for the requested computation and return if available by calling either:\n\n  * ``get_existing_datasets()`` - reads all necessary parameters and gets references to the HDF5 datasets that should\n     contain the results\n  * ``use_partial_computation()`` - pick the first partially computed results group that was discovered by\n    ``check_for_duplicates()``\n* call ``create_results_datasets()`` to create the HDF5 datasets and group objects\n* read the first chunk of data via ``read_data_chunk()`` into ``self._data``\n* Until the source dataset is fully read (``self._data is not None``), do:\n\n  * call ``unit_computation()`` on ``self._data``\n\n    * By default ``unit_computation()`` just maps ``map_function()`` onto ``self._data``\n  * call ``write_results_chunk()`` to write ``self._results`` into the HDF5 datasets\n  * read the next chunk of data into ``self._data``\n\nuse_partial_computation()\n--------------------------\nNot used in ``PeakFinder`` but this function can be called to manually specify an HDF5 group containing partial\nresults\n\nWe encourage you to read the source code for more information.\n\nAdvanced examples\n-----------------\nPlease see the following pycroscopy classes to learn more about the advanced functionalities such as resuming\ncomputations, checking of existing results, using unit_computation(), etc.:\n\n* ``pycroscopy.processing.SignalFilter``\n* ``pycroscopy.analysis.GIVBayesian``\n\nTips and tricks\n================\nHere we will cover a few common use-cases that will hopefully guide you in structuring your computational problem\n\nJuggling dimensions\n-------------------\nWe intentionally chose a simple example above to quickly illustrate the main components / philosophy of the Process\nclass. The above example had two position dimensions collapsed into the first axis of the dataset and a single\nspectroscopic dimension (``Frequency``). What if the spectra were acquired as a function of other variables such as a\n``DC bias``? In other words, the dataset would now have N spectra per location.  In such cases, the dataset would have\n2 spectroscopic dimensions: ``Frequency`` and ``DC bias``. We cannot therefore simply map the ``map_function()`` to\nthe data in every pixel. This is because the ``map_function()`` expects to work over a single spectra whereas we now\nhave N spectra per pixel. Contrary to what one would assume, we do not need to throw away all the code we wrote above.\nWe only need to add code to juggle / move the dimensions around till the problem looks similar to what we had above.\n\nIn other words, the above problem was written for a dataset of shape ``(P, S)`` where ``P`` is the number of positions\nand ``S`` is the length of a single spectra. Now, we have data of shape ``(P, N*S)`` where ``N`` is the number of\nspectra per position. In order to use most of the code already written above, we need to reshape the data to the shape\n``(P*N, S)``. Now, we can easily map the existing ``map_function()`` on this ``(P*N, S)`` dataset.\n\nAs far as implementation is concerned, we would need to add the reshaping step to ``_read_data_chunk()`` as:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    def _read_data_chunk(self):\n        super(PeakFinder, self)._read_data_chunk()\n        # The above line causes the base Process class to read X pixels from the dataset into self.data\n        # All we need to do now is reshape self.data from (X, N*S) to (X*N, S):\n        # Assuming that we know N (num_spectra) through some metadata:\n        self.data = self.data.reshape(self.data.shape[0]* num_spectra, -1)\n\nRecall that ``_read_data_chunk()`` reads ``X`` pixels at a time where ``X`` is the largest number of pixels whose raw\ndata, intermediate products, and results can simultaneously be held in memory. The dataset used for the example above\nis tractable enough that the entire data is loaded at once, meaning that ``X = P`` in this case.\n\nFrom here, on, the computation would continue as is but as expected, the results would also consequently be of shape\n``(P*N)``. We would have to reverse the reshape operation to get back the results in the form: ``(P, N)``. So we\nwould prepend the reverse reshape operation to ``_write_results_chunk()``:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    def _write_results_chunk(self):\n        # Recall that the results from the computation are stored in a list called self._results\n        self._results = np.array(self._results)  # convert from list to numpy array\n        self._results = self._results.reshape(-1, num_spectra)\n        # Now self._results is of shape (P, N) and we can store it in the HDF5 dataset as we did above.\n\nComputing on chunks instead of mapping\n--------------------------------------\nIn certain cases, the computation is a little more complex that the ``map_function()`` cannot directly be mapped to\nthe data. Alternatively, in some cases the ``map_function()`` needs to mapped multiple times or different sections of\nthe ``self.data``. For such cases, the ``_unit_computation()`` in ``Process`` provides far more flexibility to the\ndeveloper. Please see the ``pycroscopy.processing.SignalFilter`` and ``pycroscopy.analysis.GIVBayesian`` for examples.\n\nBy default, ``_unit_computation()`` maps the ``map_function()`` to ``self.data`` using ``parallel_compute()`` and\nstores the results in ``self._results``. Recall that ``self.data`` contains data for ``X`` pixels.\nFor example, ``_unit_computation()`` in ``pycroscopy.analysis.GIVBayesian`` breaks up the spectra (second axis) of\n``self.data`` into two halves and computes the results separately for each half. ``_unit_computation()`` for this\nclass calls ``parallel_compute()`` twice - to map the ``map_function()`` to each half of the data chunk. This is a\nfunctionality that is challenging to efficiently attain without ``_unit_computation()``. Note that when the\n``_unit_computation()`` is overridden, the developer is responsible for the correct usage of ``parallel_compute()``,\nespecially passing arguments and keyword arguments.\n\nOther Notes\n-----------\nWe are exploring Dask as a framework for embarrassingly parallel computation.\n\n"
