        "Introduction\n-------------\nQuite often, we need to perform the same operation on every single component in our data. One of the most popular\nexamples is functional fitting applied to spectra collected at each location on a grid. While, the operation itself\nmay not take very long, computing this operation thousands of times, once per location, using a single CPU core can\ntake a long time to complete. Most personal computers today come with at least two cores, and in many cases, each of\nthese cores is represented via two logical cores, thereby summing to a total of at least four cores. Thus, it is\nprudent to make use of these unused cores whenever possible. Fortunately, there are a few python packages that\nfacilitate the efficient use of all CPU cores with minimal modifications to the existing code.\n\n``pyUSID.parallel_compute()`` is a very handy function that simplifies parallel computation significantly to a\n``single function call`` and will be discussed in this document.\n\nExample scientific problem\n---------------------------\nFor this example, we will be working with a ``Band Excitation Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (BE-PFM)`` imaging dataset\nacquired from advanced atomic force microscopes. In this dataset, a spectra was collected for each position in a two\ndimensional grid of spatial locations. Thus, this is a three dimensional dataset that has been flattened to a two\ndimensional matrix in accordance with **Universal Spectroscopy and Imaging Data (USID)** model.\n\nEach spectra in this dataset is expected to have a single peak. The goal is to find the positions of the peaks in each\nspectra. Clearly, the operation of finding the peak in one spectra is independent of the same operation on another\nspectra. Thus, we could in theory divide the dataset in to N parts and use N CPU cores to compute the results much\nfaster than it would take a single core to compute the results. There is an important caveat to this statement and it\nwill be discussed at the end of this document.\n\n``Here, we will learn how to fit the thousands of spectra using all available cores on a computer.``\nNote, that this is applicable only for a single CPU. Please refer to another advanced example for multi-CPU computing.\n\n"

For very simple or small\n  computations, this overhead may outweigh the speed-up gained with using multiple cores.\n* Parallelizing computations that read and write to files at each iteration may be actually be noticeably *slower*\n  than serial computation since each core will compete with all other cores for rights to read and write to the file(s)\n  and these input/output operations are by far the slowest components of the computation. Instead, it makes sense to\n  read large amounts of data from the necessary files once, perform the computation, and then write to the files once\n  after all the computation is complete.
